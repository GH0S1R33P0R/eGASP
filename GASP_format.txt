GASP, which stands for Gpu Aspect Style Programming, 
is a format which will be used to write the policies for CUDA

NEED:
Function "signature" where we have
Qualifier, return type, and name. e.g. __global__ void inc

All the code is inserted verbatim.
The "Pre-execution" into the function at the beginning
The "Pre-return" prior to all instances of return.
The "Post-execution" at the end of the function.

Format of the policy is in the form,
       @begin signature in a dedicated line.
       @preExec 
        Pre-execution code
       @preReturn
        Pre-return code
       @postExec
        Post-execution code
       @end

NOTES:
    Can have multiple policies in a file. Can't have more than one per funciton.
    Make sure that the directives are each on a seperate new line.
    Ensure a space after each directive

    Don't have any of the directives in the policy code anywhere at all!
    Also, every policy hast to have ALL of the directives. 
        If you don't want the policy to affect a section, just keep it empty
